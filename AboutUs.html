        <div>
            <img src="Images/logo2.png" alt="wound" class="KhIMU">
            <p>
                For this project we teamed up with KhIMU, a leading medical university known for training highly skilled healthcare professionals. KhIMU focuses on both education and research, ensuring students gain hands-on experience through internships and clinical practice. <br><br>Their involvement in this project strengthens the integration of AI in reconstructive surgery and medical training, particularly for wartime injuries. By leveraging AI-driven tools like 3D scanning, thermal imaging, and ultrasound, KhIMU aims to improve wound care and surgical outcomes. Their commitment to innovation helps shape the future of medical education and enhances healthcare practices in critical conditions

            <h3>Our Discovery</h3> 
            <div> <p>Gunshot wounds to soft tissue are common in the ongoing war in Ukraine, making up 58% of all injuries. About 23% of patients need reconstructive surgery due to large wounds, especially near joints. One common method is using nearby tissue to cover these wounds, as it does not require special equipment. However, predicting how the tissue will stretch and how this affects movement remains a challenge.

            For successful healing, the tissue used in reconstruction needs a good blood supply. More research is needed to understand how blood flows through these tissues. <br> <br> To address this, we aim to develop advanced diagnostic software using artificial intelligence. This system will combine 3D scanning of wounds, thermal imaging to study blood flow in small vessels, and ultrasound to examine deeper blood circulation. By integrating these technologies, we can improve treatment and recovery for injured patients.

    <h3>  An Innovation Not Far Away: Transforming Wound Diagnostics with 3D Scanning  </h3>
    <div>
        <img src="Images/leo.png" alt="3D Leo" class="leo">
        <p>
            We have identified an existing 3D scanner, the Artec Leo, as a key component for implementing our diagnostic system. <br>
            This cutting-edge handheld scanner offers wireless operation, real-time AI-driven processing, and high-resolution structured-light scanning, making it highly suitable for capturing detailed 3D models of wounds. <br>
            By incorporating Artec Leo into our system, we can accurately assess wound dimensions, tissue structure, and healing progress. When combined with thermal imaging for blood flow analysis and ultrasound for deeper circulation insights, this technology will significantly enhance precision diagnostics and treatment planning for injured patients.
